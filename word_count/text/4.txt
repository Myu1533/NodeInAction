Working with multiple Loggers in winston

Often in larger, more complex, applications it is necessary to have multiple logger instances with different settings. Each logger is responsible for a different feature area (or category). This is exposed in winston in two ways: through winston.loggers and instances of winston.Container. In fact, winston.loggers is just a predefined instance of winston.Container:

const winston = require('winston');

//
// Configure the logger for `category1`
//
winston.loggers.add('category1', {
  console: {
    level: 'silly',
    colorize: true,
    label: 'category one'
  },
  file: {
    filename: '/path/to/some/file'
  }
});

//
// Configure the logger for `category2`
//
winston.loggers.add('category2', {
  couchdb: {
    host: '127.0.0.1',
    port: 5984
  }
});

Now that your loggers are setup, you can require winston in any file in your application and access these pre-configured loggers:

const winston = require('winston');

//
// Grab your preconfigured logger
//
const category1 = winston.loggers.get('category1');

category1.info('logging from your IoC container-based logger');

If you prefer to manage the Container yourself, you can simply instantiate one:

const winston = require('winston');
const container = new winston.Container();

container.add('category1', {
  console: {
    level: 'silly',
    colorize: true
  },
  file: {
    filename: '/path/to/some/file'
  }
});
